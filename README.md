# Emerald Game Engine

### This is still a work in progress! Many features are not finished

This is an upgraded version of my game engine which I used to make my end-of-year AP Computer Science A Project.

This project is mainly a personal project, and is designed to be used by students who have just finished APCSA, as such, certain features and documentation are meant to be simplified. 

## Features
* Easy creation of 2D Java based games
* Task Scheduler 
* Commands API
* Automatic Object Management
* Mutlithreaded rendering and logic
* User Input

To get started, check out the [Project Setup page](https://github.com/EmeraldWither/Emerald-Game-Engine/wiki/1.-Project-Setup) on the wiki.
