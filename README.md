# Emerald Game Engine

### This is still a work in progress! Many features are not finished

This is an upgraded version of my game engine which I used to make my end-of-year AP Computer Science A Project.

This project is mainly a personal project, and is designed to be used by students who have just finished APCSA.

## Features
* (In Progress) Physics Engine provided by dyn4j
* Easy creation of basic games
* Automatic rendering
* Multi-threaded

To get started, check out the [Project Setup page](https://github.com/EmeraldWither/Emerald-Game-Engine/wiki/1.-Project-Setup) on the wiki.
